# Doctoral Degree and Total Respondents Analysis

## Overview

This analysis examines the relationship between the number of doctoral degree holders and the total number of respondents in each U.S. state, based on data from the 2022 ACS dataset (obtained via *IPUMS USA*). Using a ratio estimator approach, we estimate the total number of respondents in each state based on the proportion of doctoral degree holders in California. The findings highlight the variability in educational attainment across states and its impact on the estimation accuracy.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains simulated dataset.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions.
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, address and test data.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. The entire chat history is available in `other/llm_usage/usage.txt`.
